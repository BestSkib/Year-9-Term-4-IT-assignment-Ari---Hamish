# Year-9-Term-4-IT-assignment-Ari---Hamish
This repository displays the progress of out IT assignment, the Pico W progression and the Final code.

Purpose:
The purpose of this device is to tell the user if to much, or to little current is traveling through the device. This is used to alert and make the user aware of the current. 

Usage:
This is used to sense the current and alert user through LEDs and a Buzzer how high or low the current is. It will not crash the CPU due to the short delay we added. The user can see, and hear how high the current is, making it more inclusive and adaptible. It can be used in any industry of household dealing with electricy, allowing the user to make educated decisions on what action to take. This can make households and industry safer.


Setup:
Unfortunuatly the breadboard we were given was quite small and it was difficult to find a way to fit lots of parts. The setup for this project is 2 LEDs, potentiolmeter and buzzer. The first element are the LEDs which are used to dim and brighten using the potentiolmeter, they work through GPIO pins 14 and 15 and through groudn cables and it also required two resistors in the breadboard, the next element is the potentiolmeter which controls resistance and is our project it controls the lights brightness levels and the buzzer tone, the final part is the buzzer which plays a different tone depending on the resistance level.
